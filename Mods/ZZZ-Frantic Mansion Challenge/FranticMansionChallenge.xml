The challenge system has been reworked to reflect the specific challenges for the Spencer Mansion

The gear awarded for completing the first row of challenges has been updated. You now receive a full set of primitive armour (already on your character), plus an intellect mod.
The wrench, helmet light mod and Wasteland Treasures book are awarded.	
									
									
THE FRANTIC MANSION CHALLENGE:
Can you survive and escape the Spencer Mansion, using nothing but what you can scavenge from the mansion itself?

You have one life, one mission, one means of escape.
						
This challenge places you, a lone survivor, in the iconic Spencer Mansion from Resident Evil 1. Your only means of escape is to gather everything you need to be able to craft a gyrocopter and make your escape from the rooftop to the nearby helipad. You have one life. Make it count.


Five custom worlds, each a different biome, so you can choose your starting "difficulty" - Forest, Burnt Forest, Desert, Snow, or the ultimate challenge, Wasteland.

Custom Spencer Mansion POI made by Frantic Dan, giving you everything you need to be able to complete your quest.

Custom questline, guiding you on your way, and a Custom HUD.
					
CHALLENGE RULES: 

1: You can walk on the dirt outside, but you cannot walk beyond the dirt.

2: You may build bridges off the side of the building to reach things, but those bridges must support themselves and cannot touch the ground.

3: All default game settings, or harder, but not easier. It's recommended to have loot respawn set to 5 days.

4: If you die, the game is over.

5: You must survive until you are able to build a gyrocopter and fly off the roof.
